### What you should know before coding interview?

Make sure you know Computer science [basic data structures](#data-structures-you-should-know). Also you should be aware of [fundamental algorithms](#fundamental-algorithms-you-should-know).

### Ask Questions before coding

Once they give you problem, don't start coding. Ask clarifying questions to make sure you understand the problem.

Example:

- Will there be null/empty values on input?
- Will all numbers in a binary tree integers?
-

## What you should prepare?

### Big O

Learn Big O. Make sure you give what would be the `runtime complexity` and `memory complexity`.

`Iterative functions` take no extra memory and therefore, `memory complexity` is `constant` O(1).

`Recursive functions` take extra on the stack therefore, `memory complexity` is `lograrithmic` O(_logn_)

### Data Structures you should know

- Hash Table
- Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- Tree
- Tries
- Graphs
- Vectors
- Heaps

### Fundamental algorithms you should know

- Breadth-first search
- Depth-first search
- Merge sort

## Working with this repo

Download or clone in local machine. Then run individual file in node console to see the results.

## Arrays

### Implement Binary Search on a Sorted Array

Given a sorted array of integers, return the index of the given key. Return -1 if the key is not found.

Run below script

```
node .\src\arrays\binary-search.mjs
```

### Find Maximum in Sliding Window

Given a large array of integers and a window of size w, find the current maximum value in the window as the window slides through the entire array.

## Math & Stats

### Integer Division Without Using \* or /

Divide two integers without using '/' (division) or '\*' (multiplication) operators.

```shell
node .\src\math-and-stats\integer-division.mjs
```
