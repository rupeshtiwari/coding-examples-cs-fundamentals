## Important thing to remember

- Remember: Run through `your code` not through the `algorithm` while executing test.
- While `solving` problem: give yourself difficult values like use 7-8 elements of array not just 3 elements array. [1,2,3] instead use [12,34,22,51,6,96,43,8]
- While `executing` your code always start with very easy example [2,3,1]

## Working with this repo

- Download or clone in local machine.
- Run `npm ci`
- Then run individual file to see result on console.
- You should use `node filename` in console to see results.

## What to practice?

Make sure you know Computer science [basic data structures](#data-structures-you-should-know). Also you should be aware of [fundamental algorithms](#fundamental-algorithms-you-should-know).

## How to Approach?

### Before you code

### While you code

### After you code

#### Ask Questions before coding

Once they give you problem, don't start coding. Ask clarifying questions to make sure you understand the problem.

Example:

- Will there be null/empty values on input?
- Will all numbers in a binary tree integers?

## What you should prepare?

- [x] DataStructure
- [x] Algorithms

## Computer Science Concepts

- [x] Big O Time
- [x] Big O Space
- [x] Recursion
- [x] Memoization / Dynamic Programming

## Big O complexity

### Big O Time complexity

Learn Big O. Make sure you give what would be the `runtime complexity` and `memory complexity`.

- Array.push() is O(1) constant time complexity
- string.indexOf() search is O(n) linear time complexity
- for loop O(n) linear time complexity

### Big O Space complexity

`Iterative functions` take no extra memory and therefore, `memory complexity` is `constant` O(1).

`Recursive functions` take extra on the stack therefore, `memory complexity` is `lograrithmic` O(_logn_)

## Recursion

## Data Structure Q & A

### Array

Arrays can store a fixed number of elements, whereas a collection stores object dynamically so there is no size restrictions it grows and shrinks automatically.

- **Insert** at the end (push) is efficient.
- **Insert** at in between is not efficient.

#### Implement Binary Search on a Sorted Array

Given a sorted array of integers, return the index of the given key. Return -1 if the key is not found.

Run below script

```
node .\src\arrays\binary-search.js
```

#### Find Maximum in Sliding Window

Given a large array of integers and a window of size w, find the current maximum value in the window as the window slides through the entire array.

### Linked List

Linked lists are dynamic data structure and memory is allocated at run time. They don't store data contiguously rather they use link to point to other elements.

![ ](https://i.imgur.com/tMN6TD5.png)

Performance wise linked lists are slower than arrays because there is no direct access to linked list elements.

Suppose we have an array that contains following five elements 1, 2, 4, 5, 6. We want to insert a new element with value “3” in between “2” and “4”.

You have to copy 1,2 in new array then insert 3 and copy rest of the values. Runtime complexity and memory complexity is very high.

Therefore, we use linked list to store 1-6 and we can easily insert 3 in between 2 and 4.

![ ](https://i.imgur.com/r689svn.png)

The linked list is a list of items, called nodes. Nodes have two parts, `value` part and `link` part. Value part is used to stores the data. The link part is a reference, which is used to store addresses of the next element in the list.

- **Head**: Head is a reference that holds the address of the first node in the linked list.
- **Nodes**: Items in the linked list are called nodes.
- **Value**: The data that is stored in each node of the linked list.
- **Link**: Link part of the node is used to store the reference of other node.

```ts
class LinkedListNode {
  constructor(data) {
    this.data = data;
    this.next = null;
  }
}
```

Below are the types of LinkedList:

- **Singly Linked List**
- **Doubly Linked List**
- **Circular Linked List**

- [Answer](https://codepen.io/roopkt/pen/eYvbpEw?editors=0010)

#### Insert at head

The newly created node will become head of the linked list. · Size of the list is increased by one.

#### Insert at tail

![ ](https://i.imgur.com/Wz9Uovq.png)

#### Reverse a Singly Linked List

We’re given the pointer/reference to the head of a singly linked list, reverse it and return the pointer/reference to the head of the reversed linked list.

### Stack

Depth First Search (DFS) uses a `stack` for storing the nodes that it is visiting.

#### Popping element from stack

```ts
var stack = [1, 2, 3, 4];
stack.pop(); // 4 , stack [1,2,3]
stack.pop(); // 3 , stack [1,2]
stack.pop(); // 2 , stack [1]
stack.pop(); // 1 , stack [ ]
```

### Queue

Breadth First Search (BFS) uses a `queue` for storing the nodes that it is visiting.

#### Enqueue an element in Queue

```ts
var queue = [];

queue.push(1); //   queue [1]
queue.push(2); //   queue [1,2]
queue.push(3); //   queue [1,2,3]
```

#### Dequeue an element from Queue

```ts
var queue = [1, 2, 3, 4];
queue.shift(); // 1 , queue [2,3,4]
queue.shift(); // 2 , queue [3,4]
queue.shift(); // 3 , queue [4]
queue.shift(); // 4 , queue [ ]
```

### Tree

A tree has hierarchical data and it has nodes. It is a type of graph. Each node (except root) has exactly on parent and zero or more children.
A tree is `acyclic` meaning it has no cycles: "a cycle is a path [AKA sequence] of edges and vertices wherein a vertex is reachable from itself".
Therefore, a tree is also called as `Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)`.

![ ](https://i.imgur.com/wUiUy0B.png)

- **Root**: top node of tree is called root and has no parent and has no incoming edges.
- **Node**: every node has parent ( except root ) and 0 or more children's.
- **Edge**: used to connect two nodes.
- **Path**: A path is an ordered list of nodes that are connected by edges.
- **Leaf**: A leaf node is a node that has no children.
- **Height of the tree**: The height of a tree is the number of edges on the longest path between the root and a leaf.
- **The level of node**: The level of a node is the number of edges on the path from the root node to that node.
- **Children**: Nodes that have incoming edges from the same node to be said to be the children of that node.
- **Parent**: Node is a parent of all the child nodes that are linked by outgoing edges. - **Sibling**: Nodes in the tree that are children of the same parent are called siblings.
- **Ancestor**:  A node reachable by repeated moving from child to parent.

If you want to store hierarchical data use Tree.

You should know about `Binary Tree` and `Binary Search Tree`.

#### Breadth-first Traversal (BFT)

In BFS algorithm, a graph is traversed in layer-by-layer fashion. point. The queue is used to implement BFS.

![ ](https://i.imgur.com/i7nf4go.png)

Example: Suppose you have given a tree structure and asked to calculate the average of numbers at each level.

- **Strategy**: `Iterative`
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n logn)`
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n logn)`
- Use `Queue` while coding.

- [Breadth-first Traversal Answer](https://codepen.io/roopkt/pen/XWMBdWv?editors=0010)

#### Depth-first Traversal (DFT)

The DFS algorithm we start from starting point and go into depth of graph until we reach a dead end and then move up to parent node (Backtrack). The stack is used to implement DFS.

![ ](https://i.imgur.com/4P7FMDl.png)

- **Strategy**: `Recursive`
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n logn)`
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n logn)`
- Use `Recursive Call Stack` while coding.

### Binary Tree

A binary tree is a type of tree in which each node has `at most two children` (0, 1 or 2) which are referred as left child and right child.

![ ](https://i.imgur.com/fkRP5Ju.png)

#### Minimal Binary Tree

A Minimal Binary Tree has about the same number of nodes on the left of each node as on the right.

#### Binary Search Tree (BST)

In Binary Search Tree nodes are:

- The key in the left subtree is less than the key in its parent node.
- The key in the right subtree is greater or equal the key in its parent node.

![ ](https://i.imgur.com/u5WpbHe.png)

[Checkout Binary Search Tree Visualization here.](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/BST.html)

BSTs get an average case of `O(log n)` on gets, adds, and deletes, but they can have a worst case of `O(n)` if you do something like add a sorted list to a BST. Go ahead, do a BST then add [1,2,3,4,5] to it.

Below image showing how to add `[3, 7, 4, 6, 5, 1, 10, 2, 9, 8]` in BST.

**Binary Search Algorithm**

![](https://i.imgur.com/WYh0bug.png)

Binary Search can be done both in iterative or recursive way.

![](https://i.imgur.com/PWjbCaZ.png)

Binary Search tree has left sub tree which is `less than or equal` to root. And right subtree which is `strictly greater` than the root.

### Trie

Trie is a tree, in which we store only one character at each node. This final key value pair is stored in the leaves.

![ ](https://i.imgur.com/o9UWgEN.png)

Trie is also suitable for solving partial match and range query problems.

### Heap ( Priority Queue )

Each node in the heap follows the rule that the `parent value is greater than its two children` are.

![ ](https://i.imgur.com/J5If65C.png)

There are two types of the heap data structure:

- **Max heap**: each node should be greater than or equal to each of its children.
- **Min heap**: each node should be smaller than or equal to each of its children.

A heap is a useful data structure when you want to get max/min one by one from data.

### Hash-Table

It is just like a dictionary or key value pair.

### Graph

![ ](https://i.imgur.com/kYlxMWJ.png)

Graph represents network. It has Nodes, Vertices and Edges.

#### Breadth First Search (BFS)

When you want to find all possible routes between airports then you want to use BFS.
Find all possible routes from `PHX` to `BKK`. Also then you can decide which path is the shortest one.

## Algorithms Q&A

### Merge Sort

Browser's JavaScript Engine (`Array.prototype.sort`) uses merge sort maximum time. Runtime complexity O(n logn), Memory complexity O(n) because we have to create new list. It uses divide-and-conquer algorithm! and also it is recursive.

#### Find Median Values (With Merge Sort Algorithm)

2 sorted arrays find the median element. Median is the middle index its not an average of values in an sorted array.

![ ](https://i.imgur.com/anPm3Yx.png)

So in order to find median we can use the stich algorithm since arrays are already sorted. Then we can find the middle index.

### Why Quick sort is used in Array and Merge Sort in Linked List?

In Quick sort we do not create auxiliary arrays. Therefore, it is good choice for Array to use quick sort. However in merge sort we create 2 auxiliary arrays. Therefore, linked list is a good choice.

## Mathematics & Stats You should know

### How to initialize array of size n?

Example create an array containing numbers from 0 to 9.
`[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`

```js
var y = new Array.from(Array(10).keys());
```

### How many zeros in 1 Billion

Answer: 9

1,000,000,000 = 1 Billion

### How many zeros in 1 Million

Answer: 6

1,000,000 = 1 Million

### Integer Division Without Using \* or /

Divide two integers without using '/' (division) or '\*' (multiplication) operators.

```shell
node .\src\math-and-stats\integer-division.js
```

## JavaScript Fundamentals


### Initialize 2D Array 4x4 with 0

```js
const x = new Array(4).fill( new Array(4).fill(0))
```

![](https://i.imgur.com/JXVJGgJ.png)


### JavaScript Map

```js
const map = new Map();
// insert
map.set('key', 'value');

// get
map.get('key');

// remove
map.delete('key');

// check key exist
map.has('key');

// size
map.size;
```

### Array Sort

By default `array.sort` does not work you must pass delegate method.

```js
var a = [23, 4, 2, 155, 43];
a.sort();
// output: [155, 2, 23, 4, 43] Not sorted at all.
```

![](https://i.imgur.com/w9jmc3O.png)

In order to sort in `ascending` order you must pass delegate method.

### Array Sort

**Ascending Order Sorting**

```js
var a = [23, 4, 2, 155, 43];
a.sort((a, b) => a - b);
// output: [2, 4, 23, 43, 155]
```

![](https://i.imgur.com/LWQHaAE.png)

**Descending Order Sorting**

```js
var a = [23, 4, 2, 155, 43];
a.sort((a, b) => b - a);
// output: [155, 43, 23, 4, 2]
```

### What is an Integer

An integer is a whole number that can be either greater than 0, called positive, or less than 0, called negative. Zero is neither positive nor negative.

### increment letters by 3

Letters asci code starts from `96` to `122`.

- `charCodeAt()` gives the ascii code.
- `String.fromCharCode(code)` converts code to string.

```js
const letter = 'A';
const newKey = (letter.charCodeAt() + 3) % 122;
const result = String.fromCharCode(newKey);
console.log(result); //"D"
```

### How to convert -ve to +ve number?

```js
Math.abs(-4); //4
Math.abs(2); //2
```

### Array slice

Slice does not mutate the original array.
`slice(index,count) `: Starts taking number from
given index and go till given count.

[Example of slice](https://i.imgur.com/9iaew6W.png):

```js
[20,39,48,58,16,36,48].slice(0,3) = [20,39,48]
[20,39,48,58,16,36,48].slice(3,7) = [58,16,36,48]
```

![ ](https://i.imgur.com/9iaew6W.png)

### Math.floor

```javascript
Math.floor(2.5) = 2
Math.floor(2.8) = 2
Math.floor(2.4) = 2
```

### Math.round

```javascript
Math.round(2.5) = 3
Math.round(2.8) = 3
Math.round(2.4) = 2
```

### JavaScript Integer Max Min

`Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` is the largest integer which can be used safely in calculations.

For example, `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` + 1 === `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` + 2 is true — any integer larger than MAX_SAFE_INTEGER cannot always be represented in memory accurately. All bits are used to represent the digits of the number.

It is 16 digit number.

- `Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER` = -9007199254740992
- `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` = 9007199254740991

#### Check if a given binary tree is BST ( Binary Search Tree )

**Binary Search Tree (BST)**: is a binary tree in which for each node value of all the nodes in the left subtree is lesser or equal to the root node. And the values of all the nodes in the right subtree is greater than the root node.

In order to find a tree as BST we must `define each node range` that is its outer and inner bound values and iterate the tree and compare their ranges.

#### Find an element in a circularly sorted array

Circularly sorted array means a rotated sorted array. Find index of `8` in `[12, 14, 18, 21, 3, 6, 8, 9]` array.

**💡 Hint:**

- Brute Force => `O(n)` search each element of an array. Don't code for it.
- Optimized => `O(logN)`

`Circularly sorted array` will have at least one half completely sorted.
And the other half where you have the pivot element there elements will be also sorted after pivot element.
Try `Binary Search`.

## Binary Search for competitive programming from zero to advanced

Binary Search is used to solve 2 kinds of problems:
1- Search problems, find real numbers.
2- Optimization problems. Maximize element x keeping y minimum. Or minimize element x keeping y maximum.

### Binary Search Concept

- Watch [Code School Binary Search Videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uXyPJ0Pew&list=PL2_aWCzGMAwL3ldWlrii6YeLszojgH77j)
- Watch this [Binary Search conceptual video from Errichto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GU7DpgHINWQ&list=PLl0KD3g-oDOHpWRyyGBUJ9jmul0lUOD80)

Next you have to solve some basic binary search problems.

### Binary Search Basic Problems

- Do all basics problems related to binary search [that I have given in this link](https://codepen.io/collection/vBORpO)
- Next do all below advanced problems

### Binary Search Advanced Questions

Below problems are lying under optimization problems. Just watch `Book Allocation` and `Aggressive Cows` videos (links are below) to understand optimization logic. Once you understood them after that for rest problems you need to apply same logic. Every iteration you reduce the search space by either maximizing or minimizing the solution.

- [Book Allocation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss9ta1zmiZo&t=1335s)
- [Aggressive Cows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TC6snf6KPdE)
- [Painter's Partition](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/painters-partition-problem/)
- [EKO (SPOJ)](https://www.spoj.com/problems/EKO/)
- [PARATA - Roti (SPOJ)](https://www.spoj.com/problems/PRATA/)

## Greedy Algorithm

It is useful for optimization problem.
Below is the template for Greedy Algorithm.

- Watch [these videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzeK7g8cD0Y&list=PLqM7alHXFySESatj68JKWHRVhoJ1BxtLW&t=0s) to learn greedy algorithm

```js
getOptimal(items, n)
1- Initialize result as 0
2- while(all items are not considered) {
  i = selectAnItem()
  if(feasible(i))
    result = result +1;
}
3- return result;
```

### Min Coins Problem

<p class="codepen" data-height="300" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="js,result" data-slug-hash="XWRmVLj" data-user="rupeshtiwari" style="height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;">

</p>

Note: Greedy Algorithms may not work always like Longest Path in Binary Tree.

### Where Greedy Algorithms can be used?

Below are the standard problems solved by Greedy Algorithms. I have solved first 4 problems listed below:

https://codepen.io/collection/QWbzGB 

- Activity Selection
- Fractional Knapsack
- DIEHARD
- DEFKIN
- Job Sequencing
- Huffman Coding
- Prim's Algorithm
- Kruskal's algorithm
- Dijkstra's algorithm
- Finding close to optimal solutions for `NP Hard Problem` like `Travelling Salesman Problem`

### Huffman Coding
Merge 2 smallest and make one node.
Next select 2 smallest and make one node. 
Repeat the merge process

Always select 2 minimum one is called as Greedy Algorithm.
This is called as Optimal Merge Pattern Tree which is Greedy approach

## BST 

### For Finding PREDECESSOR 
	- Take a LEFT then go extreme RIGHT to get predecessor of given node
	- While going right update predecessor

### For Finding SUCCESSOR 
	- Take a RIGHT then go extreme LEFT to get successor of given node
	- While going left update successor
